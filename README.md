# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description
This weeks challenge was to build a API for a social network web application. In the application, users have the ability to share thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage & update thoughts and friend lists. Technologies used were Express.js for routing, MongoDB as a database, and Mongoose ODM for data modelling, as well as JavaScript and Node.js. 

The functionality of this application relies on Mongoose, and works effectively when the server can be started and the Mongoose models are synced to the database. With the ability to open API GET routes, the data is displayed in JSON. Testing of API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, allows the success of creating, updating and deleting users and thoughts in the database. API POST and DELETE routes have the ability to create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a users list

## Installation
